                  These Website Terms &amp; Conditions (“T&amp;Cs”) apply to
                  your access and use of www.iVerified.live (the “Site”) as a
                  legal and binding agreement, including all software, data,
                  reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content made
                  available through any portion of the Site (collectively, the
                  “Content”). Content includes all such elements as a whole, as
                  well as individual elements and portions thereof.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  iVerified permits you (“User” or “you” or “your”) to access
                  and use the Site, Platform, Programs and Content, subject to
                  these T&amp;Cs. By accessing or using any portion of the Site,
                  you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
                  be bound by these T&amp;Cs. If you are entering into these
                  T&amp;Cs on behalf of a company or other legal entity (“User
                  Entity”), you must have the legal authority to contractually
                  bind such User Entity to these T&amp;Cs, in which case the
                  terms “you” or “your” or “User” will refer to such User
                  Entity. If you lack such legal authority to contractually bind
                  or you do not agree with these T&amp;Cs, you must not accept
                  these T&amp;Cs or access or use the site or content.

                  iVerified will post the changes to these T&amp;Cs on the Site
                  and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms
                  were last revised. It is your responsibility to check the
                  T&amp;Cs periodically for changes. Your continued use of the
                  Site and Content after the date any such changes become
                  effective constitutes your acceptance of the new or revised
                  T&amp;Cs.

                <p><strong>Return and Refund Policy.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by iVerified,
                  full payment for participation in a Program is required at the
                  time of registration. In the case of Programs that include a
                  trial window, such trial window shall be made available only
                  after the full payment. During the trial window, upon a
                  request by the student, and to the satisfaction of iVerified,
                  iVerified may choose to refund the Program Fees paid, subject
                  to deduction of such applicable charges as may be decided by
                  iVerified from time to time. Once the trial window is closed,
                  there will be no refund allowed for any reason whatsoever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling into a

                  To make payment for any Program or to purchase any services or
                  products offered by iVerified through the Platform, you must

                  damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
