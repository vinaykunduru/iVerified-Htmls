                  This Privacy Policy applies to our website, and its associated
                  subdomains (collectively, our “Service”) alongside our
                  application, iVerified. By accessing or using our Service, you

                <p>
                  Appropriate use and protection of personal data is our highest
                  priority. Thus, the following policy is designed to inform you
                  about the processing of your personal data and your rights
                  according to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),
                  California Consumer Privacy Act (“CaCPA”) and other data

                <p>
                  We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide
                  such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries,
                  respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the
                  Services or use certain Services. Wherever iVerified collects
                  Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this
                  Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal
                  Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with
                  this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the
                  Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data
                  may be transferred from your current location to the offices
                  and servers of iVerified and the authorized third parties
                  referred to herein located in the United States.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Non-Identifiable Data.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  When you interact with iVerified through the Services, we
                  receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
                  information. Such information, which is collected passively
                  using various technologies, cannot presently be used to
                  specifically identify you. iVerified may store such
                  information itself, or such information may be included in
                  databases owned and maintained by iVerified affiliates, agents
                  or service providers. The Services may use such information
                  and pool it with other information to track, for example, the
                  total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors
                  to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our
                  visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note
                  that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

                <p><strong>Aggregated Personal Data.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users
                  of the Services, iVerified often conducts research on its
                  customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the
                  Personal Data and other information provided to us. This
                  research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis,
                  and iVerified may share this aggregate data with its
                  affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate
                  information does not identify you personally. iVerified may
                  also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe
                  our services to current and prospective business partners, and
                  to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

                <p><strong>Third-Party Tracking and Analytics.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We may allow third-party service providers to use cookies or
                  similar technologies to collect information about your
                  browsing activities over time and across different websites
                  following your use of the Services. For example, we may use
                  Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google,
                  Inc. (“Google”), and a number of SaaS products. They use
                  cookies or similar technologies to help us analyze how users
                  function and use our mobile applications and the Site to
                  improve our Service. We may also implement Google Analytics
                  features based on Display Advertising (which may include
                  Remarketing with Google Analytics). Visitors can opt-out by
                  using Google’s Ads Settings or going to
                  tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Please note that

                  interest to protect our website and to improve the quality of
                  our services. Additionally, your personal data is only stored

                  survey, an online application, or for online purchase
                  (performance of a contract). We have taken appropriate
                  measures to ensure that the data provided to us during
                  registration is adequately protected. These measures include,

                <p>
                  In operating the Services, we may use a technology called
                  “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the
                  computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when
                  you access the Services. They are stored as small text files
                  on your device. Our cookies help provide additional
                  functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services
                  usage more accurately. To make your visit to our website more
                  pleasant, and to enable the use of certain functions, we may
                  use “cookies” on various pages. For instance, our Site may set
                  a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the
                  Services without needing to remember and then enter a password
                  more than once during a visit to the Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use cookies for different purposes including essential
                  cookies to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of
                  user accounts, to enable certain functions of the Service, to
                  provide analytics, to store your preferences, and to enable
                  advertisement delivery. In addition to our own cookies, we may
                  also use various third-party cookies to report usage
                  statistics of the Service. In all cases in which we use
                  cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your
                  permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the
                  browser session (when you close your browser). Other cookies
                  remain on your device and enable us, or our partner companies
                  and other authorized third parties, to recognize your browser
                  on your next visit. Browsers can be customized and/or
                  configured to accept or reject cookies based on your personal
                  preference. On most web browsers, you will find a “help”
                  section on the toolbar. For more information, see the help
                  section of your Internet browser. If cookies are not accepted,
                  the functionality of our website may be limited, you might not
                  be able to use all of the features we offer or store your

                  Personal data provided to us via our website will only be
                  stored until the purpose for which they were processed has
                  been satisfied. Insofar as retention periods under commercial
                  and tax law must be observed, the storage period for certain
                  data can be up to 3 years. However, storage periods may also
                  be amended due to our legitimate interest (e.g. to guarantee
                  data security, to prevent misuse, or to prosecute criminal
                  offenders).

                  iVerified, like many businesses, sometimes hires other
                  companies to perform certain business-related functions.
                  Examples of such functions include mailing information,
                  maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ
                  another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only
                  provide them with the information that they need to perform
                  their specific function.

                  our Privacy Policy, we are going to explain exactly how and

                  Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified
                  individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
                  could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces
                  of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends
                  beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include
                  financial information, political opinions, genetic data,
                  biometric data, IP addresses, physical addresses, sexual
                  orientation, and ethnicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
                  Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal,
                  and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a
                  person would reasonably expect. Personal data should only be
                  collected to fulfill a specific purpose and it should only be
                  used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they
                  need personal data when they collect it. Personal data should
                  be held no longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose.
                  People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own
                  personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and
                  that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to
                  another organization.
